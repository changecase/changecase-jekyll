Jeff Jacobson-Swartfager
========================

Jeff has been accused of being a bit of a typography nerd. While it is true 
that he loves a good ligature and a solid grid sytem, he is also an illustrator 
and builder. This fine fellow obsessively collects new skills like a 
Lepidopterist collects butterflies in a field.

He has been working in Desktop Publishing since 2007 and in Graphic Design 
since 2006. He's often a good person to talk to when you are having a problem 
with Adobe software or with your fonts in general.

Occasionally you may find Jeff volunteering his time to effect political change, 
contributing to news, culture, and food magazines, or making awesome things 
with the Portland Tech community.

Jeff believes beauty and functionality are intimately related and works to 
incorporate both into any project he is a part of.

Jeff plays well with others.
