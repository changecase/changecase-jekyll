        <p>I’ve been using <a href="https://github.com/blahed/frank" title="Frank, the Static Site Non-Framework">Frank</a> to generate the static pages of a few sites I’m working on. This has been great, especially for data that is generated, but doesn’t change all that much.</p>

<p>It has led to cleaner files and faster load times. I’ve been seperating the various views into layouts, cleaning up the construction of the html with <a href="http://haml.info/" title="The HAML markup language">haml</a>, automating tasks with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" title="Ruby programming language">Ruby</a>, and composing copy in <a href="https://github.com/bhollis/maruku" title="Maruku mantained by Ben Hollis">maruku</a>.</p>

<p>I ran into a problem the other day though.</p>

<h2 id="the_problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>We use Citrix’s GoToMeeting, GoToTraining, and GoToWebinar for a few activities at Advisicon. We expose our schedule of upcoming webinars and online training sessions with the GoToTraining API and the GoToWebinar API. I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/citrixonline/GoToTraining-Ruby">GoToTraining Ruby API wrapper</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/citrixonline/GoToWebinar-Ruby">GoToWebinar Ruby API wrapper</a> to produce the upcoming calendars.</p>

<p>This has been working great, but I realized that the code between the two is pretty similar. I could remove the redundancy by moving the Ruby out of the page and into its own method that encapsulates both GoToTraining and GoToWebinar. This would also enable me to use a single maruku filter in haml, improving the readability and utility of markdown.</p>

<p>First, I need to successfully move at least one of them out of the calling page.</p>
